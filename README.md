# Malaria-Detection-Project
Malaria Detection using CNN
This project aims to detect the presence of malaria parasites in a given image of blood cells. The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from the link https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria. The project uses deep learning techniques to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the images into parasitized and uninfected cells.

Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run this project:

zipfile
os
PIL
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
tensorflow
Outputs/Results
The project aims to classify images into parasitized and uninfected cells. The model built achieved a test accuracy of 98.3%. The confusion matrix and classification report were generated to evaluate the performance of the model.
